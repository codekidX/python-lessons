# Lesson 2 - types of variables
# DO python L2.py and compare output with code

# use buit-in type function to know variable types

# 'hello' is stored in x (NOTICE: no type definition required) like String x or int x
x = 'hello'
print "x is 'hello'"
print type(x) # shows which type of variable x is
print ' ' #blank
print ' '
x = 5
print "x is 5"
print type(x) # shows which type of variable x is
print ' ' #blank
print ' '
x = 3.3
print "x is 3.3"
print type(x) # shows which type of variable x is
print ' ' #blank
print ' '
x = 555555555555555555555
print "x is 555555555555555555555"
print type(x) # shows which type of variable x is
print ' ' #blank
